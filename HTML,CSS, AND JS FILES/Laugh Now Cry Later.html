                    Yeah<br>
                    Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby<br>
                    I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)<br>
                    We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby<br>
                    Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?<br>
                    Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react<br>
                  </p>
                  <p id="lyrics-long" style="display: none;">
                    Woah, woah <br>
                    Yeah<br>
                    Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby<br>
                    I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)<br>
                    We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby<br>
                    Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?<br>
                    Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react<br>
                    Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at<br>
                    Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that<br>
                    Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy<br>
                    Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap<br>
                    Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy<br>
                    I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back<br>
                    I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad<br>
                    What they had didn't last, damn, baby<br>
                    Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby<br>
                    I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)<br>
                    We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby<br>
                    Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?<br>
                    I'm in the trenches, relax<br>
                    Can you not play that lil' boy in the club?<br>
                    'Cause we do not listen to rats<br>
                    We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me "Tae is the best"<br>
                    Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net<br>
                    I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched<br>
                    Hmm-hmm, Ooh-oh<br>
                    Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs<br>
                    Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take<br>
                    And I never been embraced<br>
                    And the money's hard to make<br>
                    So I bet they on they face right now<br>
                    I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad<br>
                    What they had didn't last, damn, baby<br>
                    Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby<br>
                    I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)<br>
                    We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby<br>
                    Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?<br>
                    When he tell the story, that's not how it went<br>
                    Know they be lyin', a hundred percent<br>
                    Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'<br>
                    Valet just called me to tell me come get it<br>
                    Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit<br>
                    If it was me, they wouldn't regret it<br>
                    Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah<br>
                    Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'<br>
                    Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden<br>
                    Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea<br>
                    And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it<br>
                    It's hard to believe it<br>
                    I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad<br>
                    What they had didn't last, damn, baby<br>
                    Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby<br>
                    I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby (baby)<br>
                    We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby<br>
                    Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that? <br>
