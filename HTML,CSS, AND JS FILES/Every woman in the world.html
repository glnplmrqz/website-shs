                    I was never in love, never had the time <br>
                    In my hustle and hurry world <br>
                    Laughing my self to sleep <br>
                    Waking up lonely <br>
                    I needed someone to hold me, oh <br>
                    It's such a crazy old town <br>
                    It can drag you down <br>
                    'Til you run out of dreams <br>
                    So you party all night to the music and lights <br>
                    But you don't what happiness means <br>
                    I was dancing in the dark with strangers <br>
                    No love around me <br>
                    When suddenly you found me, oh <br>
                    Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
                    You're my fantasy, you're my reality <br>
                    Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
                    You're everything I need, you're everything to me <br>
                    Oh girl <br>
                    Everything good, everything fine <br>
                    That's what you are <br>
                    So put your hand in mine <br>
                    And together we'll climb <br>
                    As high as the highest star <br>
                    I'm living a lifetime in every minute <br>
                    That we're together <br>
                    And I'm staying right here forever, oh <br>
                    Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
                    You're my fantasy, you're my reality <br>
                    Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
                    You're everything I need, you're everything to me <br>
                    Oh girl <br>
                    Girl, you're every woman in the world to me <br>
